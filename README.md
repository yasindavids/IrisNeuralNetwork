# Iris Neural Network
Deep Learning model that takes four flower measurements as input features and predicts the species of Iris (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) using a fully connected neural network. If you scroll to the bottom of the notebook you will see the output.

I began this project to learn the technologies, which is why the code is filled with personal notes and such to help me remember and understand when I look back.
